Martin Fowler Refactoring 2nd edition example sources

# Usage
## Test code shows the intentions
A test code describes all usages of examples, so see a test code first and reads the intentions and flows of examples.

## ~001.js is a starter code
~001.js is the original code before refactoring. Refactoring proceeds as the number of codes increases.
